    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Gumbo is an <em>undisputed</em> Louisiana staple, right up there with jazz and fluffy beignets. But what exactly is gumbo? Like all Cajun and Creole cooking, gumbo pulls its flavors and techniques from a diverse combination of African, Native American, French, and Spanish cultures. The name “gumbo”, while often thought to have French origins, is actually derived from the West African word for okra, ki-ngombo. Okra, one of many crops that made its way to the American south via Trans-Atlantic slave trade, was commonly used as a thickener for this earthy stew. Now it’s much more likely to find okra in seafood and Creole variations, and omitted from meat-heavier Cajun ones, like this recipe.</p>

            </li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, finely chopped
            </li>
            <li>2 bay leaves
            </li>

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>2 tbsp. fresh thyme, chopped

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, paprika, pepper, garlic powder, mustard powder, and cayenne.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken thighs dry and season all over with 1 tbsp plus 2 tsp of spice mixture. Sear the chicken thighs in the hot oil, turning occasionally for even browning, until cooked through, about 12 minutes. (The chicken should have a brown crust on both sides.) Transfer the chicken to a large bowl.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Add the sausage to the same pot and cook until it starts to brown slightly and the edges begin to curl, about 3 minutes. Transfer the sausage to the bowl with the chicken.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Add ½ cup of chicken broth and deglaze the pot, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits left behind. Pour the deglazing liquid over the chicken and sausage and set aside to cool.</li>
        <br>

        <li><strong>Make the roux:</strong> Wipe the pot clean and return to medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 cup oil and heat until you start to see wisps of smoke. Add the flour all at once, reduce heat to medium-low, and whisk continuously. Continue cooking and occasionally whisking, allowing the roux to darken until it reaches a deep brown, milk chocolate color, about 20-25 minutes. (The texture should resemble wet sand.)</li>
        <br>

        <li>As soon as the roux is done, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, bay leaves and a big pinch of salt. Increase the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently to keep the roux from burning. Add garlic, scallion whites, and thyme, and cook for an additional 1 minute. Whisk in the remaining 6 cups chicken broth.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Using clean fingers or a fork, shred the chicken into bite sized pieces, then return the chicken, sausage, and deglazing liquid to the pot. Bring everything to a simmer and cover. Allow the gumbo to simmer for at least 1 hour (and up to 4 hours) to give the flavors a chance to meld. Remove bay leaves and top with green onions before serving.</li>
