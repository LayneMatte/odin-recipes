            <li>4 cups parsley, stems removed, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Louisiana hot sauce (or 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons salt (adding 1 teaspoon at a time to taste)</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            
            <li> Put butter into very large heavy-bottomed stockpot; melt over medium heat. (Use crawfish fat if you have it.) Add onions, peppers, parsley, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and lemon juice. Simmer, covered, stirring often, for 1 hour. (This will make its own juice.)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt if necessary. Add the crawfish. Cook, covered, until crawfish turn red and tail meat is cooked through, about 10 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly.</li>
            <br>

            <li>To eat, use fingers to separate head from tail. Peel back tail shell and eat tail meat. Serve with plenty of napkins.</li>
